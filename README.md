# Webquiz

Webquiz is a **quiz application** that prompts random trivia questions.

- Questions can be customized at [main menu](https://angeloyana-dev.github.io/webquiz/)

> [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com) is the source of all generated questions.

## Issue
- At question and answer page, you might encounter the time where you get error message even after many refresh, its probably because [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com) returned **0 questions**. If that happens, just change some of your customization.
